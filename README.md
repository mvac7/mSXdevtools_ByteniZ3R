## Description

Generates tables of 8 bits unsigned values, from waveforms or binary files, in different programming languages (BASIC, C or ASM).

This tool is designed primarily to support cross-development of retro-computer applications.
   
This software was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019.

## History of versions

This application started as a tool that generated tables of random numbers that I used for the development of the visual effects application veejingSX for MSX computers.

Later I would add the option to load binary files and dump them in tables formatted for different programming languages.

The next step was to generate mathematical forms to use as paths for sprite movement and thinking of a future version that will serve for musical waveforms (thinking of the SCC).

The most current versions have a new name because one day I woke up with the need to provide a unique and cool name. 
<br/>The thinking brain behind the new name is Mr. [Fubukimaru](http://www.gamerachan.org/fubu/).
